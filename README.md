# Task: Calculator program

# Description:
Create a console application "Calculator".
The application should read from the console the arithmetic operations entered by the user and display the result of their execution in the console.

Requirements:
The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations with two numbers: a + b, a - b, a * b, a / b. The data is transmitted in one line (see example)! Solutions in which each number and arithmetic operation is passed from a new line are considered incorrect.
The calculator can work with both Arabic (1,2,3,4,5...) and Roman (I,II,III,IV,V...) numbers.
The calculator must accept numbers from 1 to 10 inclusive, not more. At the output numbers are not limited in size and can be any.
The calculator can work only with integers.
The calculator can only work with Arabic or Roman numerals at the same time, and when a user enters a string like 3 + II, the calculator should throw the exception and stop working.
If the user enters unsuitable numbers, the application throws an exception and terminates its work.
If the user enters a string that does not correspond to one of the arithmetic operations described above, the application throws the exception and terminates its work.
Example of program operation:
Input:
1 + 2

Output:
3

Input:
VI / III

Output:
II.

Principles of performance evaluation:
Pay attention to the principles of OOP, try to divide the program into logical classes. Solutions in which the entire program code is in one class will be rated low. Demonstrate your ability to work with different syntactic constructs, don't forget about exceptional situations when the program execution is impossible due to incorrect input data.
